	//Regular Expressions ************************************************************************************* 
	/* Regex are written inside of forward slashes / like this /
	If a slash is inside a regex it must be escaped by a backwards slash /\//
	
	Square Brackets [ ]  are used to denote a set in Regex. They group what you are trying to find.
	To find an asterisk or curly brace you could do this: var asteriskOrBrace = /[\{\*]/;
	the curly brace and asterisk are escaped.Non numeric chars have special meaning in a regex ( like asterisk)
	so when referring to the actual value its a good idea to escape those characters with an backslash. Below are a 
	few symbols:
	
	. = any symbol
	\d = a digit
	\w = any alpha numeric character
	\s = any whitespace such as a line break, tab or space
	\b = a word "boundry" which can be punctuation, a start of a string, or whitespace.
	
	| indicates an or option /(hot|cold)(weather|women)/
	
	*** after the closing slash you can add options by using a flag /i for instance 
	means case insensitive 
	
	
	//replacing the above letters with their capital counterpart inverts the logic. Thus 'S' instead of 's' would refer to NOT a space.
	// in additon to this inversion tool when using [ ] for a set you can use the carat symbol ^ inside to invert the logic of the pattern
	
	//to match that a string starts with somethign use ^ 
	//to match it ends with something use $
	
	* allows it to repeat any number of times
	+ occurs at least one time
	? makes something optional
	
	{ # } after the pattern is the number of times a pattern can occur so { 4 } means it can only happen once
	{ least X, most Y } pattern must happen at least X number of times and at most Y number. 
	{ 2, } means 2 or more and { , 4 } means 4 or less
	
	//A date pattern 
	var date = /\d{1,2}\/\d\d?\/\d{4}/;
	
	//email pattern
	var email = /\b[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w{2,3}\b/
	
	instead of using search on the string or charAt or indexOf you can use match for Regex and 
	instead of returrning a position in the character array where the occurence was found it will 
	return an array of the matched elements.
	
	Practice: 
	*/
	
	//1) find a digit surrounded by a space
	//var query = "1d 7b y6 8j s8 8k 9 ";
	//console.log( query.search(/\s\d\s/) );
	
	//var query = "born 15/11/2003 mother Spot: White Fang";
	//console.log( query.search(/[2\d][2\d][4\d]/) );
	
	
	//2) matches a username
	//var query = "admin3365" //True
	/* var query = "admin336519374h4i38237292" //false
	console.log( query.match(/^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$/) ); 
	*/
	
	//-- all letters 
	//-- all numbers
	//-- underscore or hyphen
	//-- min 3 letters max 16
	
	//3) Matching an email
	var query = "peb7268@gmail.com" //True
	//var query = "$$peb7268@gmail.com" //False
	console.log( query.match(/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/));
